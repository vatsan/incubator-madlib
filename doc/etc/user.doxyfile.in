# Using the PROJECT_BRIEF tag one can provide an optional one line description
# for a project that appears at the top of each page and should give viewer a
# quick idea about the purpose of the project. Keep the description short.

# With the PROJECT_LOGO tag one can specify an logo or icon that is
# included in the documentation. The maximum height of the logo should not
# exceed 55 pixels and the maximum width should not exceed 200 pixels.
# Doxygen will copy the logo to the output directory.

PROJECT_LOGO           = ../imgs/madlib.png

# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute)
# base path where the generated documentation will be put.
# If a relative path is entered, it will be relative to the location
# where doxygen was started. If left blank the current directory will be used.

# Note: For madlib, we want this to be a path relative to the repository root.

# If the EXTRACT_STATIC tag is set to YES all static members of a file
# will be included in the documentation.

EXTRACT_STATIC         = NO

# The INTERNAL_DOCS tag determines if documentation
# that is typed after a \internal command is included. If the tag is set
# to NO (the default) then the documentation will be excluded.
# Set it to YES to include the internal documentation.

INTERNAL_DOCS          = NO

# Set the SHOW_USED_FILES tag to NO to disable the list of files generated
# at the bottom of the documentation of classes and structs. If set to YES the
# list will mention the files that were used to generate the documentation.

SHOW_USED_FILES        = NO

# Set the SHOW_FILES tag to NO to disable the generation of the Files page.
# This will remove the Files entry from the Quick Index and from the
# Folder Tree View (if specified). The default is YES.

# If the value of the INPUT tag contains directories, you can use the
# FILE_PATTERNS tag to specify one or more wildcard pattern (like *.cpp
# and *.h) to filter out the source-files in the directories. If left
# blank the following patterns are tested:
# *.c *.cc *.cxx *.cpp *.c++ *.d *.java *.ii *.ixx *.ipp *.i++ *.inl *.h *.hh

# Doxygen selects the parser to use depending on the extension of the files it
# parses. With this tag you can assign which parser to use for a given extension.
# Doxygen has a built-in mapping, but you can override or extend it using this
# tag. The format is ext=language, where ext is a file extension, and language
# is one of the parsers supported by doxygen: IDL, Java, Javascript, CSharp, C,
# C++, D, PHP, Objective-C, Python, Fortran, VHDL, C, C++. For instance to make
# doxygen treat .inc files as Fortran files (default is PHP), and .f files as C
# (default is Fortran), use: inc=Fortran f=C. Note that for custom extensions
# you also need to set FILE_PATTERNS otherwise the files are not read by doxygen.

# configuration options related to the input files
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# The INPUT tag can be used to specify the files and/or directories that contain

# Enable the USE_MATHJAX option to render LaTeX formulas using MathJax
# (see http://www.mathjax.org) which uses client side Javascript for the
# rendering instead of using prerendered bitmaps. Use this if you do not
# have LaTeX installed or if you want to formulas look prettier in the HTML
# output. When enabled you also need to install MathJax separately and
# configure the path to it using the MATHJAX_RELPATH option.

# VERBATIM_HEADERS is set to NO.

SOURCE_BROWSER         = NO

# If the VERBATIM_HEADERS tag is set to YES (the default) then Doxygen

# Configuration options related to the dot tool
#---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If the CLASS_DIAGRAMS tag is set to YES (the default) Doxygen will
# generate a inheritance diagram (in HTML, RTF and LaTeX) for classes with base
# or super classes. Setting the tag to NO turns the diagrams off. Note that
# this option also works with HAVE_DOT disabled, but it is recommended to
# install and use dot, since it yields more powerful graphs.

CLASS_DIAGRAMS         = NO

# If the CLASS_GRAPH and HAVE_DOT tags are set to YES then doxygen

# indirect inheritance relations. Setting this tag to YES will force the
# CLASS_DIAGRAMS tag to NO.

CLASS_GRAPH            = NO

# If the COLLABORATION_GRAPH and HAVE_DOT tags are set to YES then doxygen
# will generate a graph for each documented class showing the direct and
# indirect implementation dependencies (inheritance, containment, and
# class references variables) of the class with other documented classes.

COLLABORATION_GRAPH    = NO

# If the GROUP_GRAPHS and HAVE_DOT tags are set to YES then doxygen
# will generate a graph for groups, showing the direct groups dependencies

GROUP_GRAPHS           = NO

# If the DIRECTORY_GRAPH and HAVE_DOT tags are set to YES
# then doxygen will show the dependencies a directory has on other directories
# in a graphical way. The dependency relations are determined by the #include
# relations between the files in the directories.

# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_LATEX is set to YES.

LATEX_OUTPUT           = latex

# The LATEX_CMD_NAME tag can be used to specify the LaTeX command name to be
# invoked.
#
# Note that when enabling USE_PDFLATEX this option is only used for generating
# bitmaps for formulas in the HTML output, but not in the Makefile that is
# written to the output directory.
# The default file is: latex.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_LATEX is set to YES.

# trees in general.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_LATEX is set to YES.

COMPACT_LATEX          = NO

# The PAPER_TYPE tag can be used to set the paper type that is used by the

# The LATEX_HEADER tag can be used to specify a personal LaTeX header for the
# generated LaTeX document. The header should contain everything until the first
# chapter. If it is left blank doxygen will generate a standard header. See
# section "Doxygen usage" for information on how to let doxygen write the
# default header to a separate file.
#
# Note: Only use a user-defined header if you know what you are doing! The
# following commands have a special meaning inside the header: $title,
# $datetime, $date, $doxygenversion, $projectname, $projectnumber. Doxygen will
# replace them by respectively the title of the page, the current date and time,
# only the current date, the version number of doxygen, the project name (see
# PROJECT_NAME), or the project number (see PROJECT_NUMBER).
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_LATEX is set to YES.

LATEX_HEADER           =

# The LATEX_FOOTER tag can be used to specify a personal LaTeX footer for the
# generated LaTeX document. The footer should contain everything after the last
# chapter. If it is left blank doxygen will generate a standard footer.
#
# Note: Only use a user-defined footer if you know what you are doing!
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_LATEX is set to YES.

LATEX_FOOTER           =

# The LATEX_EXTRA_FILES tag can be used to specify one or more extra images or
# other source files which should be copied to the LATEX_OUTPUT output
# directory. Note that the files will be copied as-is; there are no commands or
# markers available.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_LATEX is set to YES.

LATEX_EXTRA_FILES      =

# If the PDF_HYPERLINKS tag is set to YES, the LaTeX that is generated is
# prepared for conversion to PDF (using ps2pdf or pdflatex). The PDF file will
# contain links (just like the HTML output) instead of page references. This
# makes the output suitable for online browsing using a PDF viewer.
# The default value is: YES.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_LATEX is set to YES.

PDF_HYPERLINKS         = YES

# If the LATEX_PDFLATEX tag is set to YES, doxygen will use pdflatex to generate
# the PDF file directly from the LaTeX files. Set this option to YES to get a
# higher quality PDF documentation.
# The default value is: YES.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_LATEX is set to YES.

USE_PDFLATEX           = YES

# If the LATEX_BATCHMODE tag is set to YES, doxygen will add the \batchmode
# command to the generated LaTeX files. This will instruct LaTeX to keep running
# if errors occur, instead of asking the user for help. This option is also used
# when generating formulas in HTML.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_LATEX is set to YES.

LATEX_BATCHMODE        = YES

# If the LATEX_HIDE_INDICES tag is set to YES then doxygen will not include the
# index chapters (such as File Index, Compound Index, etc.) in the output.

# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_LATEX is set to YES.

LATEX_HIDE_INDICES     = NO

# If the LATEX_SOURCE_CODE tag is set to YES then doxygen will include source
# code with syntax highlighting in the LaTeX output.
#
# Note that which sources are shown also depends on other settings such as
# SOURCE_BROWSER.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_LATEX is set to YES.

LATEX_SOURCE_CODE      = NO

# The LATEX_BIB_STYLE tag can be used to specify the style to use for the
# bibliography, e.g. plainnat, or ieeetr. See
